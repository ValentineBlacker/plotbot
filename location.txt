in space
on a distant planet
in the near future
in the distant future
in the recent past
in the distant past
in the adventurous realm of the high seas
in the netherworld
in the gritty streets of a modern city
in a town just like yours
in a world where magic is real
in the glamorous world of high-stakes racing
in war-torn slums
in an alternate dimension
in the wild West
in the far East
under the sea
in cyberspace
in an enigmatic dreamworld
in a world as far away as your imagination
in the criminal underworld
in a time travel adventure gone wrong
in a series of dungeons
in a realm of magic and fantasy
in exotic locales
in a hellish dystopia
in a musical adventure
in the era of knights and chivalry
in a land of swords and sorcery
in a metaphor for love and loss
in an endless techno-rave
throughout history
on an uncharted island
inside their own mind
in a sylvan paradise
in a sacred realm
in an abandoned hospital
through a realm of light and shadow
